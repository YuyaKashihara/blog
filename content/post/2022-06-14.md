Good evening.It's been a while since I've posted.
The past few days have been busy with hospital visits, going to the gym, and resuming my job search.

I felt the difficulty of making English a habit.
I was busy, but I never stoppped reading my vocabulary book.
I want to make sure I never stop posting blogs, even if I have a break of a day or two.
