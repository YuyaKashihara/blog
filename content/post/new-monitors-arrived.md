Sorry I was too busy yeseterday to update my blog.

Today arrived new monitors.
Recently, I bought a monitor, even thought it was expoensive, because it was hard to write programming code with dual display.

But it took me 5-6 hours to set up the video before I could project it, and I was tired.

My english materials have arrived, so I'll start studying in earnest tomorrow.
