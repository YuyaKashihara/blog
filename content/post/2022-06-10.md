It's been about a year since I moved here from Tokyo.
In the beginning, I cooked every day, but as I go busier at work, I cooked a little less frequently.

Futhermore, Recently started learning english, so I am hard more before.
I can't reduce my work hours, so I have started to reduce my sleep hours.

The goal is to make learning English a habit, so I want to take it easy. good night.
