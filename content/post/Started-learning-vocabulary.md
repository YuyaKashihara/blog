I forgot to write my diary...

Today I was researching how to learn English.
I think what I lack now is vocabulary, so I'm going to buy "システム英単語" which I used to use when I was a student, and study it.

If you memorize the examples in the vocabulary book, you'll have more phrases to use.

I'll do my best. good night.
