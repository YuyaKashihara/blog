      <description>Good evening.It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve posted. The past few days have been busy with hospital visits, going to the gym, and resuming my job search.
I felt the difficulty of making English a habit. I was busy, but I never stoppped reading my vocabulary book. I want to make sure I never stop posting blogs, even if I have a break of a day or two.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been about a year since I moved here from Tokyo. In the beginning, I cooked every day, but as I go busier at work, I cooked a little less frequently.
Futhermore, Recently started learning english, so I am hard more before. I can&amp;rsquo;t reduce my work hours, so I have started to reduce my sleep hours.
The goal is to make learning English a habit, so I want to take it easy.</description>

      <description>Sorry I was too busy yeseterday to update my blog.
Today arrived new monitors. Recently, I bought a monitor, even thought it was expoensive, because it was hard to write programming code with dual display.
But it took me 5-6 hours to set up the video before I could project it, and I was tired.
My english materials have arrived, so I&amp;rsquo;ll start studying in earnest tomorrow.</description>

      <description>I forgot to write my diary&amp;hellip;
Today I was researching how to learn English. I think what I lack now is vocabulary, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to buy &amp;ldquo;„Ç∑„Çπ„ÉÜ„É†Ëã±ÂçòË™û&amp;rdquo; which I used to use when I was a student, and study it.
If you memorize the examples in the vocabulary book, you&amp;rsquo;ll have more phrases to use.
I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best. good night.</description>
