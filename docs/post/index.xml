      <description>Sorry I was too busy yeseterday to update my blog.
Today arrived new monitors. Recently, I bought a monitor, even thought it was expoensive, because it was hard to write programming code with dual display.
But it took me 5-6 hours to set up the video before I could project it, and I was tired.
My english materials have arrived, so I&amp;rsquo;ll start studying in earnest tomorrow.</description>

      <description>I forgot to write my diary&amp;hellip;
Today I was researching how to learn English. I think what I lack now is vocabulary, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to buy &amp;ldquo;„Ç∑„Çπ„ÉÜ„É†Ëã±ÂçòË™û&amp;rdquo; which I used to use when I was a student, and study it.
If you memorize the examples in the vocabulary book, you&amp;rsquo;ll have more phrases to use.
I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best. good night.</description>
